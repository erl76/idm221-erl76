## **Introduction | Biography**
Welcome, it’s wonderful to have you here. My name is Emma Long. I’m currently a full-time second-year student at Drexel University in Philadelphia. My focus lies in the realm of computer science, but more specifically, I’m majoring in UXID(User Experience and Interaction Design).

In this space, we embrace spontaneity and experimentation. You could even consider this website my variety act. Here, you might find the perfect blend of all things creative. From more traditional arts-sketching, painting, sewing, crocheting, and building cosplays-to digital art mediums-designing websites, photo manipulation, and digital artwork-you’ll find it all here. Now, let’s get it started!
